<!--
Normally we'd collect information about your projects using an online form,
but the CS web-site is being retired and SAFE isn't up to the task yet.  As 
an interim solution the idea is that

- you complete this XML file, replacing the template content but retaining
  the structure, and submit it via SAFE,
  then
- later, and hopefully (semi-)automatically, we'll import it into SAFE for 
  you in order to drive the assessment process.

This submission is intended to collect a precise and definitive set of admin. 
details from you.  Changes to the project topic etc. are out of scope, and
at your descression: we simply want details required to drive the assessment
process and so on.  Take care to complete *all* the fields correctly, since
missing or incorrect information can be problematic later.

<!-- 
In this section, we want

1. your CS user name 
   (e.g., "jl8971"),
2. your project title (even if you change this later),
3. the full name of                your Supervisor within  CS,
   (e.g., "Dan Page"),
4. whether said Supervisor is  confirmed or tentative,
5. the full name (and affiliation) any  Advisor(s) outside CS 
   (e.g., an industrial collaborator such as "Fred Bloggs, IBM"),
6. whether said Advisor(s) are confirmed or tentative,
   and
7. whether your project is of type enterprise or research (which implies you
   are also registered on the associated "sister unit").
